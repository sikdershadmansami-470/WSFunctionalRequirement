The following are the functional requirements for a wilderness weather station:

1.1 Must be able to record and process readings from the instruments that measure weather parameters, e.g. thermometer, barometer

1.2 Must record and process the immediate data before sending it to the central server every half hour

1.3 Must only have the immediate data saved for the half hour it was recorded in and was being processed. Files overwritten every half hour after being sent to the main server and new readings are recorded.

2.1 Must keep track of the battery life and overall health of the modules that record the data and the machine that processes them. This data is also sent to the main server soo it can keep track of the modules that need maintenance and are functional.

2.2 Processed weather data is used to find optimal times to charge the instruments and turn off the generator in particularly bad weather.
